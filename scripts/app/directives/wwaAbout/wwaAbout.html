                <p>Hi there!</p>
                <p>
                    My name is Ted Bui, an aspiring Front-End Developer looking to create unique user experiences designed to be 
                    simple and fun.

                    I currently live in Seattle, Washington where I take care of my old puppy Kaya. She's 10 years old and she's a cute little granny.

                    One of my hobbies I like to do in my free time is crafting some woodwork. 
                    One day I would like to build out my very own woodshop where I can start on a lot of DIY projects I've always dreamed about doing.
